# JFXFontExamples README

This example JavaFX app is modeled after the Font Book application on MacOS. It doesn't all of the functionality of Font Book, and it is using the standard "Modena" gui theme so it's not as nice looking, but the idea is simple. By examining the code and reading the tutorial that goes with it, you'll learn about how Fonts work in JavaFX, as well as how to display, change font sizes and choose specific fonts as part of a font family. For example, the font family "Helvetica" has six styles (Light, Regular, Light Oblique, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique). See more in the docs directory of this project.
