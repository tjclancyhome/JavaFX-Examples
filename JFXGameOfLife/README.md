Game of Life
============
A JavaFX Implementation of Game of Life
---------------------------------------

## Introduction

This is a simple JavaFX implementation of John Horton Conway's Game of Life.

I just began work on a JavaFX version of a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970 called Game of Life (or just Life).

Here are some resources I found to help me understand cellular automata as well as to refresh my memory about the Game of Life:
